# Project: Astronomy Picture of the Day - NASA (APOD)

## Description
This project is developed as part of CS410P - Rust Web Development by Hieu Vu. It is a web application that provides users with access to the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) using the NASA API. The project is built using Rust's Axum framework and Sqlx for database interaction, with Postgres configured using Docker.

## How the Project Works
The project's main functionality revolves around fetching and displaying Astronomy Pictures of the Day. The workflow is as follows:
1. When a user searches for an APOD, the system first checks its database for the result.
2. If no result is found in the database, the system queries the NASA API to retrieve the APOD for the requested date.
3. The retrieved result is then added to the system's database for future use and displayed to the user.
4. Over time, as more users interact with the system, the database becomes more comprehensive, improving the user experience.

## Website Features
The website offers the following features:

1. User Registration:
   - Users are required to register for an account using their email address.
